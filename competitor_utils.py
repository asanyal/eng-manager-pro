        You are an expert in competitor analysis.

    3. Return on Investment (ROI) Claims:

    4. Target Audience:
    - Describe the types of users or customers the company targets, including specific industries, roles, or user personas.

    5. Pricing Information:
    - Extract any pricing details, plans, or cost-related information, if available.

    - Column 1: Titles of the sections. 
    - Column 2: Extracted information.
     Make the titles capital letters. Don't use ** or _ symbols so the generated text is clean. 
     If available, get information on the industry, founding year, current funding status, the founders, the company's mission, and the company's services. 
     Ensure all information is directly referenced from the document.
